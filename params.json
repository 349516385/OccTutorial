{"name":"Occtutorial","tagline":"Tutorials for OpenCASCADE, the open source CAD kernel","body":"# OccTutorial\r\nThis repository contains a set of tutorials for OpenCASCADE, the open source geometry kernel.\r\nYou can read more about OpenCASCADE at http://www.opencascade.org\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\nThe tutorials are being written and tested in Ubuntu 15.10. For the quickest start, it is therefore recommended to follow the tutorials using Ubuntu. \r\n\r\n### What if I am using Windows?\r\nThe easiest way is to install Ubuntu as a VirtualBox guest on your Windows machine, which will give you access to a fully\r\nfunctioning Ubuntu operating system. Make sure you also install the guest additions, to have 3D acceleration enabled.\r\n\r\n## Install OpenCASCADE\r\nInstall OpenCASCADE using your the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo apt-get install liboce-*\r\n</pre>\r\nTo be able to visualize the geometric models in the earlier chapters, it is also recommended to install FreeCAD:\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo apt-get install freecad\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Download the tutorial sources\r\nMake a folder for the tutorial sources, e.g. in your home folder\r\n<pre>\r\ncd ~\r\nmkdir occtutorial\r\nmkdir occtutorial/sources\r\n</pre>\r\nThen, clone the repository from GIT:\r\n<pre>\r\ncd ~/occtutorial/sources\r\ngit clone https://github.com/lvk88/OccTutorial.git\r\n</pre>\r\nThis will create ~/occtutorial/sources/OccTutorial.\r\n\r\n##Build the tutorial\r\nThe build system is based on CMAKE, and we are aiming for an out-of-source build. Therefore, we make a build folder:\r\n<pre>\r\nmkdir ~/occtutorial/build\r\n</pre>\r\nNext, we run CMAKE to generate us the Makefiles:\r\n<pre>\r\ncd ~/occtutorial/build/\r\ncmake ~/occtutorial/sources/OccTutorial\r\n</pre>\r\nIf everything went without error, we can build the tutorials:\r\n<pre>\r\ncd ~/occtutorial/build\r\nmake\r\n</pre>\r\nThis will build the tutorials into build/bin directory. Each executable represents a small example of OpenCASCADE functionality.\r\n##Run the first demonstrative example\r\nNow that the tutorials are built, you can run the first demonstrative example.\r\n<pre>\r\ncd ~/occtutorial/build/bin\r\n./chapter0\r\n</pre>\r\nThis will create a simple box with a cylindrical hole, and print out some of its physical properties. The source of this can be found in\r\nsource/OccTutorial/Chapter0_Test/chapter0.cpp. It also creates an output file of the geometry in STEP format. You can open and examine it\r\nusing FreeCad for example. The file is located in build/bin/boxWitHole.stp\r\n\r\n##How are the tutorials organized\r\nThe series is organized into Chapters, with each chapter focusing on one or two packages of OpenCASCADE. With the exception of Chapter0, every chapter\r\nconsists of an \"inc\", \"src\", and \"runners\" folder. Obviously, inc contains the headers for the given chapter, src the source files. Runners is a special\r\nfolder, which contains a set of driver files, each having its own main function. When building OccTutorials, the executable output will be compiled into \r\n@build/bin@\r\n\r\n## Where to go now?\r\nThe tutorials are strongly under construction right now, but a detailed explanation of each source will be available at the wiki soon. Until then, the comments in the\r\nfiles explain more or less what each example is doing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
