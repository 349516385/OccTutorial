# OccTutorial
This repository contains a set of tutorials for OpenCASCADE, the open source geometry kernel.
You can read more about OpenCASCADE at http://www.opencascade.org

## Quick start
The tutorials are being written and tested in Ubuntu 15.10. For the quickest start, it is therefore recommended to follow the tutorials using Ubuntu. 

### What if I am using Windows?
The easiest way is to install Ubuntu as a VirtualBox guest on your Windows machine, which will give you access to a fully
functioning Ubuntu operating system. Make sure you also install the guest additions, to have 3D acceleration enabled.

## Install OpenCASCADE
Install OpenCASCADE using your the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install liboce-*
<\pre>
To be able to visualize the geometric models in the earlier chapters, it is also recommended to install FreeCAD:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install freecad
<\pre>
